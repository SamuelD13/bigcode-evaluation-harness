It first strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the date string. Then it splits the date string into its components: month, day, and year, separated by a hyphen. It converts these components to integers. If the month is not between 1 and 12, the function returns False. If the day is not within the appropriate range for the given month (1-31), the function returns False. For February, the function checks if the day is within the range 1-29.

If `txt` contains a space, it splits the string into a list of words based on spaces. If `txt` contains a comma, it replaces the commas with spaces and then splits the string into a list of words. If `txt` does not contain a space or a comma, it counts and returns the number of lowercase letters with an ASCII value that is an even number.\n<|EOT|"], ["This Python function named `is_sorted` checks if a given list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

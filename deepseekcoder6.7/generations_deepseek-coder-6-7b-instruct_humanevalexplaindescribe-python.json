Repeat the process until the number becomes 1.\n\nThe function only keeps track of the odd numbers in the sequence, and returns them in ascending order.

It first strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the date string. Then, it splits the date string into its components: month, day, and year, separated by a hyphen. Each component is converted to an integer. The function then checks if the month is between 1 and 12, and if the day is valid for the given month. For months with 31 days, it checks if the day is between 1 and 31. For months with 30 days, it checks if the day is between 1 and 30. For February, it checks if the day is between 1 and 29.

The function works by first checking if `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names and if they are not the same. If they are, it returns an empty list. If they are valid, it calculates the index of `planet1` and `planet2` in the `planet_names` tuple, and then returns a slice of the `planet_names` tuple that starts at the index of `planet1` and ends at the index of `planet2`, with the index of `planet2` being the starting index if `planet1` is smaller."], ["This Python function takes a list of strings as input, sorts them in alphabetical order, and then returns a new list that contains only the strings whose length is even.

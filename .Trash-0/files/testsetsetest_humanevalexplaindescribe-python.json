It first strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the date string. Then, it splits the date string into its components: month, day, and year, each separated by a hyphen. The function then converts these components to integers. If any of these conversions fail, the function returns False, indicating an invalid date. The function then checks if the month is between 1 and 12, the day is between 1 and 31, and the year is a positive integer. If these conditions are not met, the function returns False.
